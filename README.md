# COVID-19-face-mask-detection

In this project we can detect if a person is wearing a mask or not.
   
  1) MTCNN â€“ Multi-task Cascade Convolutional Neural Network
    - Used to detect a human faces in an image and also used to localize the face in that image
    - can detect human faces in unconstrained environment which is challenging due to various poses, illuminations and occlusions
 
 Install in python uisng
           
           pip install mtcnn
 Visit https://pypi.org/project/mtcnn/ for further information

  2) Teachable Machine is used for Training the Mask detection model ( https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image )
